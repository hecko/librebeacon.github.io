LibreBeacon is a site to document, explain and educate open-source community about iBeacons.

In short, iBeacon is a small, usually battery-powered device, which uses Bluetooth 4 (also called Bluetooth Low Enery (BLE) or SMART) wireless advertisement packets in a specific format. These wireless packets are picked-up by Apps running on iOS enabled devices - such as iPbones and iPads. They have a very special meaning for iOS - they can wake-up Apps which can do various things in the background - such as notify you about the offers in the restaurant you are walking-by or a special offer on goods being sold in a shop across the street.

The appls can also notify you on where you currently are in the shop and if you are looking for a particular item to buy where to go to get it. iBeacons drive position-aware applications - sort of like a small-private GPS network.

This sites aim is to develop and examine the most open way to design, run and deploy iBeacons - especially design very cheap, long-running iBeacons hardware that is completely open - hece the name "LibreBeacon".
